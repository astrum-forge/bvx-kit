 * VoxelGeometry is represented as an index to be used against a LUT table

 * renderer agnostic. Each Renderer will have its own configuration of a LUT
 * table.
 * 
 * Geometry Index is an 8 bit index representing the state of either the faces
 * or edges of nearby BitVoxels. 
 * 
 * - 6 bits (0-63) for face indices
 * - 8 bits (0-255) for edge indices
 * 
 * Re-Use this structure as much as possible to avoid expensive memory allocations.
 * VoxelGeometry is always computed at runtime as Voxel states can change dynamically
